# Scan

We scan the fish packed in foam in the [3D printed sample holder](https://github.com/TomoGraphics/Hol3Drs/blob/master/STL/Stickleback.Multiple.stl).
We can fit them in a field of view scanning them at 17.5 um easily.

# Reconstruct

We reconstruct the fish rotated as such that the vial *1* is on top, aligned correctly, as it would be written normally.
This means that the separator betwen *2* and *3* is horizontal to the separator between *5* and *6*.
This facilitates consistent separation of the scans into different regions with our Jupyter notebook, aiding further processing.
The bottom of the reconstruction range is set ~200 slices below the 'base plate' with the numbers.

Gray value of the reconstructions is adapted to the histogram, *discarding* the highest values in the *logarithmic* histogram, e.g. putting the upper limit at the end of the curve when looking at a region in the head of the fish.
